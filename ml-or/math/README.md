# ML x OR - Mathematical Derivationd"

Complete, from-scratch derivations of the mathematical foundations for the
ML x OR @ NeurIPS 2026 paper *"The Price of Self-Knowledge: Minimax
Information-Cost Tradeoffs and Optimal Exploration in Performative
Systems"* - the theory that a system whose deployment reshapes its own
training distribution must *purchase* knowledge of that feedback with the
objective itself, at an exact exchange rate, under a stability constraint.

Every checkable claim is verified numerically: **34/34 checks pass**
(`VERIFICATION.md`, `verify/last_run.log`). The verification process
falsified three claims as first drafted; each fix is recorded in place and
each produced a sharper result than the original.

## Result map (derivation -> paper)

| Paper object | Derivation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Theorem 1 (saturation) + Cor. 1.1/1.2 | D1 | proved + verified |
| Theorem 2 (exchange rate, pathwise) | D0 + D2 | proved + verified |
| Theorem 3a (minimax, deviation budget) | D3 sec. 2 | proved + verified (tightness shown) |
| Theorem 3b (minimax, value budget) | D3 sec. 3 | proved for the two-point family; full generality = journal item |
| Theorem 4 (design trio + dispersion factor) | D4 | proved + verified |
| Theorem 5 (safe design) | D6 | structure + safety proved; regret bound = labeled open |
| Theorem 6 (anchoring crossover) | D7 | proved + verified |
| Corollary (ROI) | D8 | proved + verified |
| Chebyshev unidentifiability | D5 | proved + verified |
| Feedback-bias scope condition | D2 sec. 4 | proved + verified (incl. sign change) |
| REFLEX instantiation (`Gamma_PO`, constants) | D8/D9 | separable case exact + verified; coupled case first-order |

## Reproduce

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python verify/verify_all.py     # numerical suite: ~4 min CPU, deterministic, exit 0 iff 34/34
python verify/check_docs.py     # document consistency: register IDs, symbol map (pass
                                # --reflex-root <path-to-endo_market_v4> to name-check the
                                # EXISTS rows against the source), LaTeX, YAML, file graph
```

The CI workflow runs both suites on every push, so the 34/34 record and the
document cross-references are a living certificate, not a one-time log.

## Conventions

Mathematics in fenced ASCII blocks (repo convention; renders identically
everywhere); notation follows REFLEX theory 1.1-1.6 (`gamma`, `beta`,
`epsilon`, `psi`, `h_SP`, `h_PO`, `m = eps beta/gamma`); every falsified
draft claim is kept visible in its document with the correction - the
falsification record is part of the method, not an embarrassment. The two
labeled-open items (D3b full generality, D6 regret) are exactly the
workshop-to-journal delta the ML x OR pipeline expects.
