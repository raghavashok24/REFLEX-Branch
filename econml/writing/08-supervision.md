# 8. Supervision from public prices

**Status: drafted, and first in the de-scope order.** Target 0.20 pages, which is
one paragraph. Source: [`../math/05-supervision.md`](../math/05-supervision.md).

Written at its cut length from the start rather than written long and trimmed,
because a section that is first to go should not be carrying material that would
have to be rescued out of it.

---

Every quantity in Sections 4 through 7 is hidden from the regulator those
sections address: no outsider observes a firm's response Jacobian, and `R` and
`s` are not filings. Near the boundary the system tells on itself. As `m_N`
approaches one the aligned combination of firms' decisions exhibits critical
slowing down, so the leading principal component of public quotes has lag-1
autocorrelation approaching one in magnitude and variance share growing like
`1/(1 - m_N)`, which lets a supervisor estimate distance to instability from
public prices alone, with no access to any firm's model, data, or code, and with
an estimator that sharpens exactly as the market approaches the boundary it is
watching for. [DEFERRED, the estimator is stated and its consistency proof, its
central limit theorem and its detection sample complexity are journal
deliverables] The sign is the part a practitioner has to get right: Result 4's
common mode has autocorrelation `-m_N`, so the diagnostic is oscillatory
co-movement rather than persistent co-movement, and a monitor watching for
persistence would look for exactly the wrong thing.

## Appendix panel

PC1 variance share and lag-1 autocorrelation of cross-sectional spread
co-movement on the 212-CUSIP panel, 1990 to 2026, overlaid on the model-implied
fragility index, **with a placebo** on Treasury and macro series where no
dealer-model channel exists.

**Framed as consistency evidence, never identification.** Co-movement is
macro-contaminated and the data is public proxies, not trade-level TRACE. The
claim is only that the observable the theory says should move, moves. Any
stronger phrasing is indefensible and an empirical-finance reviewer will say so.

## PEBSA

Cited once, for the contrast, in Section 2 rather than here so that cutting this
section does not orphan the reference. PEBSA's measurement channel is exogenous:
sentiment is a signal about an economy the observer stands outside of, and the
accuracy of the inference does not depend on the economy's own dynamics. The
observable here is endogenous, since the prices a supervisor reads are generated
by the very agents being monitored, so the measurement channel is part of the
system and the signal strengthens as the system nears instability. The value is
the contrast, not a shared method, and one sentence is the whole of it.

## Cut protocol

If this section goes, the paragraph above goes whole and nothing else moves. The
PEBSA sentence already lives in Section 2, the appendix panel stays in the
appendix, and no result in Sections 4 through 7 refers back to this one. That
independence is the reason it is placed last among the results and is what makes
it genuinely cuttable rather than nominally so.

## Checklist

- [x] One paragraph, not two
- [x] Written at cut length rather than trimmed to it
- [x] Consistency claim stated, proof deferred explicitly, flagged `[DEFERRED]`
- [x] The negative-autocorrelation sign carried over from Result 4, since it is
      what a practitioner would otherwise get backwards
- [x] PEBSA moved to Section 2 so the cut leaves nothing orphaned
- [ ] Placebo run and reported whatever it shows
- [ ] "Consistency evidence, not identification" in the appendix text

## Notes for the writing pass

**Length.** About 200 words in the body paragraph, which is the 0.20-page target.
If the page budget still binds after the compression order's first step, this
section collapses to two sentences: the critical-slowing-down observable and the
deferral. That is step two of the order in `README.md`.

**What changed against the plan of record.** The plan puts the PEBSA sentence
here or in related work and leaves the choice open. It is settled here in favour
of Section 2, because leaving it open means deciding it during the writing week,
which the plan itself warns against.
