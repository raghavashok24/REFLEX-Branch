"""Certificates for the paper's one random-ensemble number.

Source of the statement: ../../paper/appendix.tex, Appendix L, and the
optimistic-limit paragraph of Section 6.

The paper reports two kinds of empirical claim and they do not get the same
treatment. Deterministic grid checks (panels 2 to 6 against the closed forms)
are worst-case departures over a stated grid, which is a stronger statement
than an interval and is never dressed up as one. The flip rate of the
strong-correction limit is different: it is a fraction estimated on a random
ensemble, so it is a statistic and it needs its sampling measure, its n, its
exact count and an interval.

Nothing here re-argues the direction of the error. That the strong-correction
limit under-states the radius is a theorem, proved by Perron-Frobenius
monotonicity in the correction parameter and certified as C18 in
verify_theorem3_herd_immunity.py with zero violations. What is statistical is
only how often that optimism flips an actual stability verdict, which depends
on where the draws are taken from.

Checks:

  L1  the protocol         the sampling measure is the one Appendix L states
  L2  the point estimate   reproduces C18's 2157/18313 under the same seed
  L3  the interval         95 percent Clopper-Pearson, exact rather than normal
  L4  seed robustness      five independent seeds land inside a common interval
  L5  protocol dependence  a wider draw moves the fraction, so the paper says
                           which draw the number lives on
  L6  direction is not statistical  zero draws flip the other way, on every seed
