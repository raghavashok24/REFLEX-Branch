"""The paper's panels, run in the linearized reference environment.

READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING ANY NUMBER FROM HERE.

These are **dry runs**, not the paper's panels. They execute in the
heterogeneous-response environment, which realizes the model's response geometry
and nothing else: no informed flow, no spread, no inventory, no microstructure.
The paper's panels run in the base project's order-flow simulator, and until they
do, every experimental claim stays at its derivation status. Nothing here
upgrades a claim to measured.

What they are good for, which is a lot at ten days out:

  - they test the step from linearized spectrum to realized dynamics, which no
    amount of algebra checking covers
  - they fix the shape of every figure, so the simulator port has a target
  - a disagreement between these and the closed forms is a bug found cheaply,
    days before a simulator run would have found it

Measurement method. Stability is not read off an eigensolve. Each panel runs the
actual retraining map and estimates the spectral radius from the trajectory's
asymptotic growth rate by power iteration, so "measured" means measured from
dynamics. That is the one thing these runs can genuinely establish.

Panels 1 through 5 are here. Panel 6 needs Theorem 4, which is not derived.
