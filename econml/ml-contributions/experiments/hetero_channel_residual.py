"""Step 3 of the port: measure the residual from the still-shared channels.

This is the gate the design document puts in front of every heterogeneous panel,
and it is deliberately a separate script from the panels so that its number
exists before any figure does. See
../environment/HETERO-SIMULATOR-PORT-DESIGN.md, "What this does not yet handle",
item 1.

THE QUESTION. The exposure profiles route the informed-intensity channel, and
only that channel. The liquidity field is still driven by total gross flow and
by the tightest dealer's spread across the whole universe, and price impact is
still driven by total net flow. Both stay coupled at R = 1 1' no matter what the
profiles are. At the monoculture that is exactly right, since everything is
shared there anyway. Away from it there is a second coupling channel whose
alignment is 1 1' rather than R, so the measured joint modulus should be
expected to sit ABOVE m_1 * N_eff by a gap that grows with separation from the
monoculture.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES. Sweeps the shared-model fraction s from the monoculture
down to orthogonality at fixed N, using the exact nonnegative constructor
`supply_chain_profiles`, and reports

    gap(s)  =  ( measured m_N  -  m_1 * N_eff(R_measured) ) / ( m_1 * N_eff ) .

s = 1 is the in-sweep control: it must reproduce panel 1's published anchor bit
for bit, because at s = 1 the profiles are flat and the port is the base market.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It draws no figure, wires nothing into panels.py, and moves
no claim in ../../writing/CLAIMS-LEDGER.md. If the gap is large the panels are
not interpretable as planned and the design needs revisiting before any figure
is drawn, which is the whole reason this runs first.
