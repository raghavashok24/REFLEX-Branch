"""Panel 1's external anchor, measured in the base project's real simulator.

This is the one panel that does NOT need the heterogeneous-response extension.
Its claim is the monoculture corner `R = 1 1'`, which the base project already
implements and has already validated, so the anchor can be closed today while
the rest of the simulator port is still design work.

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER PANELS. Everything in `panels.py` runs
in the linearized reference environment and is flagged `[DRY RUN]`. This script
runs the genuine shared-pool market: real order flow, real spreads, real
inventory, real liquidity feedback, CRN probes through the full
deploy-collect-fit-optimize pipeline. A number that comes out of here is
`[MEASURED]`.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. The base project is read-only here. Nothing is imported
that this script writes to, no file under the base repository is modified, and
the base project's own guidance is that derived papers build on it rather than
live inside it. If the base repository is absent this script skips cleanly, so
the branch repository stays self-contained for anyone without a local checkout.

    python econml/ml-contributions/experiments/reflex_anchor.py

Requires the base project's virtual environment, since the simulator needs
torch and the branch repository's own code is numpy-only:

    "<base>/.venv/Scripts/python" econml/ml-contributions/experiments/reflex_anchor.py

Point at a non-default checkout with the REFLEX_ROOT environment variable.
